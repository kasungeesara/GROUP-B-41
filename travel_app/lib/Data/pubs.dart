This review is of the lunch experience.The Manchester is now open for lunch.Actually the board outside indicates that it serves proper meals from 12-7pm, as opposed to the limited – but tasty – side dishes from next door Agra which they serve at night. No one seems to know just yet though, as the place was empty except for us. Located away from the hustle and bustle and out of reach of most workplaces in the city may mean that the usual lunchtime crowds will stay away. Which is kinda nice, if you want to, you know, eat alone.",
